# Student-cheating-detection-in-online-exams-using-deep-learning
we developed a deep learning model for student cheating detection in online exams using OEP database videos. Our study involved data preparation, model design, and training. We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with an input shape of [48, 48, 1] and achieved a training accuracy of 99%.

Our approach involved the use of data augmentation techniques such as rotation and horizontal flipping to increase the size and diversity of the dataset. We also used a balanced dataset to avoid bias in the model training. Our CNN model was designed with two convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and three dense layers, including an output layer with a sigmoid activation function.

The high accuracy of our model can be attributed to the carefully designed architecture of our CNN model, as well as the quality and quantity of the training data. We used a range of image processing techniques, such as data augmentation, to improve the robustness of our model to variations in the input data. Additionally, the use of the binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer helped to optimize the model parameters during the training

our study demonstrated the effectiveness of using deep learning for student cheating detection in online exams. The high accuracy of our model shows the potential for its implementation in real-world scenarios to prevent cheating and ensure the integrity of online exams.
