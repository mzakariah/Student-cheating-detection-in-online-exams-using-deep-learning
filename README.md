# Student-cheating-detection-in-online-exams-using-deep-learning
we developed a deep learning model for student cheating detection in online exams using OEP database videos. Our study involved data preparation, model design, and training. We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with an input shape of [48, 48, 1] and achieved a training accuracy of 99%.
